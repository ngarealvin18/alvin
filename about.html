<h1>ABOUT GAMING</h1>
<h3>What is Gaming?</h3>
<p>Gaming is playing an electronic video game, which is often done on a dedicated gaming cons
    ole, PC or smartphone. People who often play video games are called gamers</p>
<h3>Origin of gaming</h3>
<p>The word gaming originated in the 15th century to refer to gambling in dice or card games. Gaming was used to refer to gambling until the late 1900s, where it was applied to playing recreational board games and pen-and-paper role-playing games. With the introduction
    of video games in the 1970s, the term gaming became more associated with its current use.</p>
<h3>Popularity</h3>
<p>Gaming is an extremely popular activity worldwide. The number of people who play games is estimated to be over 3 billion. Some estimates put the worldwide gaming market value between $180 billion and $220 billion in 2022. This is about double the market for the global film industry.
    The majority of the gaming market is people playing games on their smartphones</p>
<h1>Categories Of Games</h1>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Role-Playing Games (RPGs)</h3>
        <p>Role-playing games feature rich worldbuilding and “lore” to create an immersive story-telling experience. Players will take the role of a main character or group of characters, and will help these characters to reach their goals. For those familiar with Dungeons and Dragons, many early RPG mechanics were based off of concepts borrowed from D&D. Because there are a
            large number of RPG sub genres, this article only focuses on the most popular genres.</p>
    </li>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Final Fantacy</li>
        <li>Spyro</li>
        <li>Skyrim</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Sporting Games</h3>
        <p>You don’t have to have a court to play basketball or a field to play soccer when you play sports games! Some sports games try to model real-life sports as closely as possible, while others take the concept of a sport and take it in a new direction.
            For gaming consoles that use player motion, the video games can also be intend
            ed to provide a workout for the player</p>
    </li>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fifa</li>
        <li>Madden</li>
        <li>NBA</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Racing</h3>
        <p>Many people have felt the “need for speed” at some point in their life, but few really take it to an extreme. Video games cater to that desire with a plethora of racing games, involving cars, boats, snowmobiles, dirt bikes, or pretty much anything with an engine! Or, for those who want a more
            realistic experience, there are hyper-realistic vehicle simulators that
            are quite popular</p>
    </li>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Flight Simulator</li>
        <li>Railroad Simulator</li>
        <li>Grid Autosport</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Puzzle</h3>
        <p>Like in real life, puzzle games are intended to challenge the player’s mind. In solo puzzle games, players advance to the next level once the puzzle is completed, while in competitive games,
            players beat their opponents by solving the puzzle first or earning more points.</p>
    </li>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tetris</li>
        <li>Bejeweled</li>
        <li>Myst</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Casual</h3>
    <p>Casual games are intended to be simple, relaxed, and easy to pick up for just a few minutes. These games do not have complex mechanics; in fact, many can be learned in just a few minutes. Mobile devices are the largest market for casual games since they’re great for
        eating up a few minutes of boredom</p>
    </li>
    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Paper.io</li>
        <li>Slither.io</li>
        <li>Doge Miner</li>
    </ul>
